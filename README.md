# Assignment3_AppDev

This was a school assignment to make a multi-screen application in Kotlin Compose in Android Studio.
The app is to be used to create entries for magic items from Dungeons & Dragons and view them. 

## Screens
### Create Item
The user must input a name, source (PHB, homebrew, etc.) rarity, description and selected image to create a magic item.
